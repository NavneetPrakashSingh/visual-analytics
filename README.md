### Abstract

<br>
In recent years, organizations has started to apply machine learning models to predict and prevent social problems for countries all over the world. The purpose of this study is to discover and classify the impact of various variables on life expectancy for developing and developed countries. To determine and present key variables, machine learning algorithm (Decision tree) was applied to demographic data from the period from 2000 to 2010. Data cleaning and preprocessing, applying machine learning models and visualizing the appropriate parameters are presented as well. The entire process was conducted using flask for machine learning and displaying data and d3Js for visualizing graphs and charts.
